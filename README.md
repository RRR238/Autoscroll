# Autoscroll

This command line interface program automatically scrolls the screen. After the program is opened, user has to specify three parameters:

* How many pixels to scroll up or down (defined by positive or negative integers, respectively)
* How many seconds should the program wait after each scrolling
* After how many seconds should the first scrolling start (user should have enough time to place the mouse pointer in the desired window)

In order to terminate the scrolling, simply turn off the program
